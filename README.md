# Crypt Raider (UE5 Learning Project)

## Description
This is the third UE5 project created by me as part of the Udemy UE5 game development course. This project heavily relies on custom-created C++ components (Grabber, Trigger, Mover) that are added to UE Blueprints to extend their functionality. In this game, players solve puzzles to access the dungeon and steal the golden statue from the ancient mausoleum.

## What I've Learned
- Using C++ pointers and references
- Actor and Scene C++ components
- Setting up lighting for the level
- Building a level using a modular level design approach
- Creating Line Tracing channels and processing their collisions
- Using PhysicsHandle to manipulate objects in the scene
- Linking C++ components from different actors to work together
- Utilizing actors' tags for different behaviors of the components
